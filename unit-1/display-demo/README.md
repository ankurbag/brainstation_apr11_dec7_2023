## Steps to Demo

1. Do the whole lecture
2. Set up the project
3. Demo block elements
4. Demo inline elements
5. Demo inline-block elements

## Notes

- Connect the dots with Box Model lecture: we just learned that everything is a box, now we'll talk about what *kinds* of boxes there are.
- Show defaults for `div`, `img`, `span`, etc.
- Percentages / removing space between inline-block elements
- `vertical-align`
