## Steps to Demo

1. Go through the formatAge function in the lecture slides
2. Demo that function in script.js and break it down
3. Resume the lecture slides to explain the pieces of the function further
4. Demo the rest of the code with several examples of declaring and calling functions
5. Go through `bonus.js` if there's time
